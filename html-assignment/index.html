        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Logan and this is my first time making websites! I am <abbr title="2005">20</abbr> years old and my birthday is July 10<sup>th</sup>. I am big into sports and working out, I work out 6 days a week and am pretty big into it. As far as sports goes, I am really big into Hockey and Baseball, both playing and watching. I was born here in Ottawa along with my mom, but my dad was born in Montreal. I attended Farley Mowat Public School from kindergarden to grade 1. Then I went to Parkwood Hills for about half a year while the Chapman Mills Public School was being built which I attended from the last half of grade 2 to the end of grade 6. I then went to <abbr title="Cedarview Middle School">CMS</abbr> for grades 7 and 8. Then I finished off at <abbr title="John McCrea Secondary School">JMSS</abbr> from grades 9 to 12. </p>
        <p>I originally attended Algonquin College for architechure for 2 years after graduating highschool in 2023. I wasn't liking it and wasn't doing too good so I decided to drop it. I knew I wanted to stay in a design field and this caught my eye. I submitted my application for <em>Mobile Application Design and Development, Fittness and Wellness, and <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>,</em>in that order. Despite IMD being my last choice, when I got accepted into the three, I looked more into all of them and I loved the way this program sounded. So much hands on design and it's exactly what I was looking for. So far I am loving it!</p>
